# React-Portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

The purpose of this portfolio is to practice using React as well as showcasing my bootcamp projects and assignments. This will allow employers and anyone who wants to view my work to see it in a neat way. 

While building this app, I learned how to use React and implement things like Bootstrap with it.
